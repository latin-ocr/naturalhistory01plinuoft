BOOK ΙΙ. Lv. 145—LV11. 147

creature that is not always killed when struck—-all
others are killed on the spot3 nature doubtless
bestows this honour on man because so many animals
surpass him in strength. All things (when struck)
fall in the opposite direction to the flash. A man
does not die unless the force of the blow turns him
right round. Men struck from above collapse. A
man struck while awake is found with his eyes shut;
while asleep, with them open. It is not lawful to
cremate a man who loses his life in this mannen re-
ligious tradition prescribes burial. No living creature
can be burnt by lightning without being killed. The
temperature of the wound of those struck is lower than
that of the rest of the body. LVI. Among things
that grow in the ground, it does not strike a laurel
bush. It never penetrates more than five feet into
the earth3 consequently when in fear of lightning
men think caves of greater depth are the safest, or
else a tent made of the skin of the creatures called
sea-calves‚ because that alone among marine animals
lightning does not strike‚ just as it does not strike
the eagle among birds; this is why the eagle is
represented as armed with a thunderbolt as a
weapon. In Italy in the time of the Caesarian war
people ceased to build towers between Terracina
and the Temple of Fe1·onia‚as every tower there was
destroyed by lightning.

LVII. Besides these events in the lower sky, it is Rain os
entered in the records that in the consulship⁰ of ⁶²⁰⁰d’8‘0'
Manius Acilius and Gaius Porcius it rained milk and
blood, and that frequently on other occasions there it
has rained flesh, for instance in the consulship b of
Publius Volumnius and Servius Sulpicius, and that
none of the flesh left unplundered by birds of prey
