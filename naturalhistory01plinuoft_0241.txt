proximity to the centre does in the case of the
former3 the former begin to decelerate from their
morning setting, but the latter to accelerate. The
former travel backward from their morning to their
evening station, the planet Venus from her evening
to her morning station. But she begins to climb her
latitude after her morning rise, but after her morning
station to ascend her altitude and follow the sun,
being swiftest and highest at her morning setting;
whereas she begins to descend in latitude and
decelerate after her evening rising, and to turn back
and simultaneously to descend in altitude after her
evening station3 on the other hand the planet
Mercury begins to climb in both ways after his
morning rising, but after his evening rising to
descend in latitude, and following the sun at an
interval of 15 degrees he stands motionless for almost
four days. Afterwards he descends from his altitude
and proceeds back from his evening setting to his
morning rise. And only this planet and the moon
set in as many days as they have risen in3 Venus
ascends in 15 times as many days as she sets in,
while Saturn and Jupiter descend in twice as many,
and Mars in actually four times as many. So great
is the variety of nature; but the reason is evident-
bodies that strain up into the heat of the sun also have
difficulty in descending.
