on a line of their own. These things could not
occur without the earth’s being situated at the
centre.

LXX. But the three cii-cles intertwined between
the zones aforesaid are the cause of the differences
of the seasons ε the Tropic of Cancer on the side of the
highest part of the zodiac to the northward of us, and
opposite to it the Tropic of Capricorn towards the
other pole, and also the equator that runs in the
middle circuit of the zodiac.

LXXI. The cause of the remaining facts that
surprise us is found in the shape of the earth itself,
which together with the waters also the same argu-
ments prove to resemble a globe. For this is un-
doubtedly the cause why for us the stars of the
northern region never set and their opposites of the
southern region never rise, while on the contrary
these northern stars are not visible to the antipodes,
as the curve of the earth’s globe bars our view of the
tracts between. Cave-dweller Countrya and Egypt
which is adjacent to it do not see the Great and Little
Bear‚ and Italy does not see Canopus and the con-
stellation called Berenice’s Hair‚ also the one that
in the reign of his late Majesty Augustus received
the name of Caesar's Throne, constellations that are
conspicuous there. And so clearly does the rising
vault curve over that to observers at Alexandria
Canopus appears to be elevated nearly a quarter of
one sign above the earth, whereas from Rhodes it
seems practically to graze the earth itself, and on the
Black Sea, where the North Stars are at their highest,
it is not visible at all. Also Canopus is hidden from
Rhodes, and still more from Alexandria3 in Arabia in
November it is hidden during the first quarter of the

lee seasons.
