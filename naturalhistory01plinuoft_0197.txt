the clement of fire, source of yonder eyes of all those
blazing stars3 next the vapour which the Greeks and
our own nation call by the same name, air—this is
the principle of life, and penetrates all the universe
and is intertwined with the whole; suspended by its
force in the centre of space is poised the earth,
and with it the fourth clement, that of the waters.
Thus the mutual embrace of the unlike results in an
interlacing‚ the light substances being prevented
by the heavy ones from flying up, while on the
contrary the heavy substances are held from crashing
down by the upward tendency of the light ones. In
this way owing to an equal urge in opposite directions
the clements remain stationary, each in its own place,
bound together by the unresting revolution of the
world itself 3 and with this always running back to
its starting-point‚ the earth is the lowest and central
object in the whole, and stays suspended at the pivot
of the universe and also balancing the bodies to
which its suspension is due ; thus being alone motion-
