BOOK II. xvm. 82—xx. 84

arduous study of the heavens, that what when they
fall to earth are termed thunderbolts are the fires of
the three upper planets‚ particularly those of Jupiter,
which is in the middle position—possibly because it
voids in this way the charge of excessive moisture
from the upper circle (of Saturn) and of excessive
heat from the circle below (of Mars); and that this
is the origin of the myth that thunderbolts are the
javelins hurled by Jupiter. Consequently heavenly
fire is spit forth by the planet as crackling charcoal
flies from a burning log, bringing prophecies with it,
as even the part of himself that he discards does not
cease to function in its divine tasks. And this is
accompanied by a very great disturbance of the air,
because moisture collected causes an overflovv‚ or
because it is disturbed by the birth-pangs so to speak
of the planet in travail.

XIX. Many people have also tried to discover Distances ο,
the distances of the planets from the earth, and have ΜΘ planet-1.
given out that the distance of the sun from the moon
is 19 times that of the moon itself from the earth.
The penetrating genius of Pythagoras, however,
inferred that the distance of the moon from the
earth was 15‚750 miles‚<² and that of the sun from the
moon twice that figure, and of the sun from the
twelve signs of the Zodiac three times. Our fellow-
countryman Sulpicius Gallus also held this view.

XX. But occasionally Pythagoras draws on the Thetr ⁴
theory of music, and designates the distance between &gaiorum
the earth and the moon as a whole tone, that between
the moon and Mercury a semitone‚ between Mercury
and Venus the same, between her and the sun a tone
and a half, between the sun and Mars a tone (the

same as the distance between the earth and the
