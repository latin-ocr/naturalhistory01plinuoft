Syrian city of Myriandrus situated on the Gulf os
Scanderoon 5,215,fr0m there by the shortest sea-route
to the Island of Cyprus, from Patara in Lycia to
Rhodes, to the island of Asty palaea ln the Carpathi·m
Sea, 10 Taenaxus in Laconia, Lilyb ·1eum in Sicily,
Caralis 111 Saidi 113 213, thence to Cadiz 1,250, the
total distance from 1116 Ewistein Sea making 8,568
Another route, which is more certain, extends
mainly overland from the Ganges to the river
Euphrates 5,169, thence to M· ·1Ζ363 111 Cappadocia.

Alcy onian Sea and the Gulf of Corinth to Patras in
the Peloponnese 10211, 10 Leucas 871, 10 Corfu

But the breadth of the earth from the south point to
the north is calculated by Isidorus as less by about
one half, 5,462 miles, showing how much the heat has
abstracted on one side and the cold on the other.
As a matter of fact I do not think that there is this
reduction in 1116 earth, 01· that it is not the shape of a
globc, but that the uninhabitable parts on either
side have not been explored. This measurement
runs from the coast of the Ethiopic Ocean, where
habitation just begins, to Meroe 705 miles, thence

to Alexandria, 1,25Ο, Rhodes 584, Cnidus 863, Cos 25,
