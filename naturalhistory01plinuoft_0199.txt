and who is the ruler not only of the seasons and of the
lands, but even of the stars themselves and of the
heaven. Taking into account all that he effectS, we

the mind, of the whole world, the supreme ruling
principle and divinity of nature. He furnishes the
world with light and removes darkness, he obscures
and he illumines the rest of the stars, he regulates

seasons and the continuous re-birth of the year, he

storm-clouds of the mind of man, he lends his light
to the rest of the stars also3 he is glorious and pre-
eminent, all-seeing and even all-hearing——this I
observe that Homer the prince of literature held to

Punishment and Reward, reaches an even greater
height of folly. Frail, toiling mortality, remembering
its own weakness, has divided such deities into groups,
so as to worship in sections, each the deity he is
most in need of. Consequently different races have
different names for the deities‚⁶ and we find countless
deities in the same races, even those of the lower

‘ Or, altering the text, ⁴ have different deities.⁷
