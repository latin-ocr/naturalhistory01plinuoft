positions Ι shall give afterwards, although every
leap- -year they come a day earlier, but they keep the
regular rule in the peliod that follows. Certain
persons give the name Chelidonias to the VVest
wind on the 19th February, owing to the appearance
of the swallow, but some call it Ornithias‚ from the
arrival of the birds on the 7lst day after the shortest
day, when it blows for nine days. Opposite to the
West wind is the wind that we have called Subsolanus
(EN) The rise of the Pleiads in the same degrees
of Taurus on May 10 brings summer ; it is a period
of South wind, Auster, the opposite of Septentrio.
But in the hottest period of summer the Dog-star
rises, when the sun is entering the first degree of
Leo—this day is July 17. The Dog-star's rise is
preceded for about eight days by North-east winds:
these are called the Forerunners. But two days
after his rising the North-east winds begin again,
and continue blowing steadily for 30 days ; these are
called Etesian or Annual winds. They are believed
to be softened by the sun’s warmth being reinforced
by the heat of the star3 and they are the most
regular of any of the winds. They are followed in
turn by South winds, continuing to the rise of
Arcturus, which occurs 4Ο days before the autumnal
equinox. With the equinox begins the North-west
wind3 this, the opposite of Volturnus, marks the
beginning of autumn. About 44 days after the
autumnal equinox the setting of the Pleiads marks
the beginning of winter, which it is customary to
date on November 11; this is the period of the
winter Aquilo, which is very unlike the summer one
mentioned above3 it is opposite to the South-west
wind. But for six days before thc shortcst day and
