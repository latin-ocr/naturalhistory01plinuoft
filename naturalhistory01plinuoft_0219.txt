the sun being taken away from the earth by the moon
intervening and from the moon by the earth: at the
transit of the former a sudden shadow passes over
the earth, and in return the shadow of the latter
diins the heavenly body (the moon), and the dark-
ness is merely the earth's shadow‚ but the shape of
the shadow is conieal, resembling a spinm'ng-top
upside down, as it impinges only with its point and
does not go beyond the altitude of the moon, because
no other star is obscured in the same wayf' and a
conical figure always tapers off into a point: that
shadows are made to disappear by distance is proved
when birds fly to extreme heights. Consequently
the frontier between the moon and the other
heavenly bodies is at the point where the air ends
and the aether begins. All the space above the moon
is clear and filled with continual light, but to us the
stars are visible through the night in the same way
as other lights in shadows. And these are the
reasons why the moon wanes in the night-time3
but both of her wanings are irregular and not monthly,
because of the slant of the zodiac and the widely
varying curves of the moon's course, as has been
stated, the motion of the heavenly bodies not always
tallying in minute fractional quantities.

VIII. This theory leads mortal minds upward to
heaven, and discloses to their observation from that
height, as it were, the greatness of the three greatest
parts of the universe ; clearly it would not be possible
for the whole of the sun to be eclipsed from the earth
by the passage of the moon between them if the earth
were larger than the moon. The vast size of the sun
will be shownb with the more certainty from the
two bodies, so that there is no need to investigate
