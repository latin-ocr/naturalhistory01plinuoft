of Manduria in the Salentine district is full to the
brim, and is not reduced when water is drawn out of
it nor increased when water is poured into it. In
the river of the Cicones α and in the Veline Lake of
Picenum,b wood thrown into the water gets covered
with a film of stone, and in the river Smius in Colchis
this goes so far that the stone in most cases is covered
with bark still lasting.⁶ Similarly in the Sele beyond
Sorrento not only twigs but also leaves immersed in
the river become petrified, though apart from this
its water is healthy to drink. Rock forms in the
outlet of the marsh at Rieu, and olive trees and
green bushes grow in the Red Sea.

But the nature of a great many springs is of re-
markably high temperature, and this is found even
on the ridges of the Alps, and actually in the sea,
for instance in the Gulf of Baiae between Italy and
the Island of Ischia‚ and in the river Garigliano and
many others. In fact fresh water may be drawn
from the sea in a great many places, as at the Swallow
Islands and at Aradus and in the Gulf of Cadiz.
Green grass grows in the hot springs of Padua, frogs
in those of Pisa, fishes at Vetulonia in Tuscany near
the sea. A river in the district of Casino called the
Bubbling Water is cold, and is fuller in susnmer3
water voles are born in it, as they are in the Stymphalis
of Arcadia. The Fountain of Jupiter at Dodona,
though it is cold and puts out torches dipped in it,
sets them alight if they are brought near to it when
they are out. The same spring always stops flowing
at noon, on account of which it is called the Wait-a-
bit3 later it rises again and towards midnight flows
abundantly, thereafter gradually ceasing again. A
cold spring in Illyria sets fire to clothes spread out
