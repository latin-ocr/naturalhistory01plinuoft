the whole of its breadth‚ but without going at all
outside it. The planet Mercury diverges very widely
from these, but without wandering over more than
8 of the 12 degrees of latitude of the zodiac, and
these 8 not uniformly but two in the middle of the
zodiae, four above it and two below it. Then the
sun travels unevenly in the middle of the zodiac
between the two halves with a wavy serpentine
course, the planet Mars over 4 degrees in the middle,
Jupiter one in the middle and two above it, Saturn
two like the sun. This will be the principle of the
latitudes of the planets when setting towards the
South or rising towards the North. Most people
have supposed that with this system agrees also the
third mentioned above,‘² that of their rising from the
earth to the sky, and that this ascent also is made
simultaneously3 but this is a mistake. To refute
them it is necessary to develop an extremely abstruse
argument that embraces all the causes mentioned.

It is agreed ²² that the planets are nearest to the earth (min relauoe
in both altitude and latitude at their evening setting, ²⁰ ‘²³³ earth.
and that their morning risings occur at the beginning
of both altitude and latitude, while their stations
occur in the middle sections of the altitudes, called
‘ ecliptics.’ It is similarly admitted ⁶ that their
velocity increases as long as they are in the neigh-
bourhood of the earth and decreases when they
withdraw from it to a height: this theory is specially
supported by the apogees of the moon. It is equally
undoubtedd that the three higher onese moreover
increase their motion in their morning risings and
diminish it from their first (morning) stations to their
second (evening) stations. In view of these facts it
will be evident that the latitudes are ascended from
