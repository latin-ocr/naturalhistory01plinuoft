PREFACE, 14-16

us who has made the same venture, nor yet one
among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all
departments of the subject. A large part of us seek
agreeable fields of study, while topics of immeasurable
abstruseness treated by others are drowned in the
shadowy darkness of the theme. Deserving of treat-
ment before all things are the subjects included by
the Greeks under the name of ‘ Encyclie Culture ';
and nevertheless they are unknown, or have been
obscured by subleties‚ whereas other subjects have
been published so widely that they have become
stale. It is a difficult task to give novelty to what is
old, authority to what is neW, brilliance to the
common-place, light to the obscure, attraction to the
stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all
things and all her properties to nature. Accordingly,
even if we have not succeeded, it is honourable and
glorious in the fullest measure to have resolved on the
attempt.

For my own part I am of opinion that a special
place in learning belongs to those who have preferred
the useful service of overcoming difficulties to the
popularity of giving pleasure3 and I have myself
already done this in other works also, and I declare
that Ι admire the famous writer Livy when he begins
one volume ‘¹ of his History o f Rome from. tlze F cundation
of the City with the words ‘ I have already achieved
enough of fame, and Ι might have retired to leisure,
did not my restless mindb find its sustenance in
work.’ For assuredly he ought to have composed
his history for the glory of the world-conquering
nation and of the Roman name, not for his own;
it would have been a greater merit to have persevered
from love of the work, not for the sake of his own
