sphere α), and never makes its rises simultaneously
with Jupiter except in two signs only, Cancer and Leo,
whereas the planet Mercury rarely makes its evening
rises in Pisces, and most frequently in Virgo, its

morning rises in Lib1a, and also its morning rises in
Aquarius, very rarely 1n Leo; it does not make its re—

turn in Taurus and ln Gemini, and not below the 25th
degree in Cancer3 Gemini is the only sign in which

the moon makes conjunction with the sun twice,
Sagittarius the only one in which she does not meet
him at all, Aries the only one in which the old moon
and the new moon are visible on the same day or night
(and this too it has happened to few mortals to see,
hence Lynceus's reputation for keen sight); the
longest period of invisibility for the planets Saturn and
Mars is 170 days, for Jupiter 36 days3 the shortest
periods for all these are 10 days less3 Venus’s period
is 69 days or at shortest 52, Mercury's 13 or at
longest 17.

XVI. The colours of the planets vary with their
altitudes, inasmuch as they are assimilated to the
stars into whose atmosphere they come in rising,
and the circuit of another's path modifies their
colour in either direction as they approach, a colder
circuit to pallor, a hotter one to redness, a windy
one to a leaden colour, the sun and the intersection
of its orbit with theirs, and also the extremities
of their paths, changing them to black darkness. It
is true that each has its own special hue—Saturn
white, Jupiter transparent, Mars fiery, Lucifer
bright white, Vesper glaring, Mercury radiant,
the moon soft, the sun when rising glowing and
