BOOK II. xm. 69-71

their morning rising, because in that state their
acceleration first begins to dimim‘sh, but in their first
stations their altitude also is ascended‚ since then the
numbers first begin to be reduced and the stars begin
to recede. The reason for this must especially be
given. When struck in the degree that we stated
and by a triangular ray of the sun they are prevented
from pursuing a straight course, and are lifted
upward by the fiery force. This cannot be directly
perceived by our sight, and therefore they are
thought to be stationary, which has given rise to the
term ‘ station? Then the violent force of the same
ray advances and compels them by the impact of the
heat to retire‚ This occurs much more at their
evening rising, when they are driven out to the top
of their apsides by the full opposing force of the sun,
and appear very small because they are at the
distance of their greatest altitude and are moving
with their smallest velocity—which is proportionately
smaller when this occurs in the highest signs of their
apsides. From their evening rise their altitude is
descended with a velocity now dccelerating less and
less, but not accelerating before their second statims,
when their altitude also is descended, the ray passing
above them from the other side and pressing them
down again to the earth with the same force as that
with which it had raised them to the sky from the
former triangle. So much difference does it make
whether the rays come from below or from above,
and the same things occur far more in the evening
settin .

Thisg is the theory of the higher star53 that of
the rest is more difficult and has been explained by
nobody before ourselves.
