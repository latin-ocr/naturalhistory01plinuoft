BOOK II. cvr. 231-233

Andros always has the flavour of wine on J anuary 5th:
the day is called God’s Gift Day. To drink of the
Styx near Nonacris in Arcady causes death on the
spot, although the river is not peculiar in smell or
colour; similarly three springs on Mount Liberosus
in Taurica irremediably but painlessly cause death.
In the territory of Carrina in Spain there are two
adjacent springs of which one rejects all objects and
the other sucks them down3 another in the same
nation makes all the fish in it look of a golden colour‚
although except when in that water there is nothing
peculiar about them. In the district by the Lake
of Como a copious spring always swells up and sinks
back again every hour. A hot spring on the island
of Cydonea off Lesbos flows only in the springtime.
Lake Sannaus in Asia is dyed by the wormwood
springing up round it. In the cave of Apollo of
Claros at Colophon there is a pool a draught from
which causes marvellous oracular utterances to be
produced, though the life of the drinkers is shortened.
Even our generation has seen rivers flow backward at
Nero's last moments, as we have recorded in our
history of that Emperor.

Again ev·e1ybody is aware that all springs are Um az
colder in summer than in winter, as well as of the ppPJ‘
following miracles of nature: that bronze and lead
sink when' m mass form, but float when flattened out
into sheets3 that among objects of the same weight
some float and others sink3 that heavy bodies are
more easily moved in water3 that stone from Scyros
in however large a mass floats, and the same stone
broken into small pieces sinks3 that bodies recently
dead sink to the bottom but rise when they begin to
swell3 that empty vessels cannot be drawn out of
