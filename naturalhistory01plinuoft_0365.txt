lands and indeed to the whole of nature in the same
processes of rising and setting, the course or other
operation of a star being manifest beneath the
earth in just the same way as when it is travelling

past our eyes.
Moreover‚ the lunar difference is manifold‚ and

the tides, which are moderate from new moon to
half-moon, therefrom rise higher and at full moon
are at their maximum; after that they relax, at the
seventh day being equal to what they were at first;
and they increase again when the moon divides on
the other side, at the union of the moon with the sun
being equal to what they were at full moon. When
the moon is northward and retiring further from
the earth the tides are gentler than when she has
swerved towards the south and exerts her force at
a nearer angle. At every eighth year the tides
are brought back at the hundredth circuit of the
moon to the beginnings of their motion and· to
corresponding stages of increase. They make all
these increases owing to the yearly influences of the
sun, swelling most at the two equinoxes and more at
the autumn than the spring one, but empty at mid-
winter and more so at midsummer. Nevertheless
this does not occur at the exact points of time I have
specified, but a few days after, just as it is not at
full or new moon but afterwards, and not immediately
when the world shows or hides the moon or slopes
it in the middle quarter, but about two equi-
noctial hours later, the effect of all the occurrences
in the sky reaching the earth more slowly than the
sight of them, as is the case with lightning, thunder
and thunder-bolts.
