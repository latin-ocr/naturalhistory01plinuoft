do not increase in bulk with the daily accession of so
many rivers. The consequence is that the earth at
every point of its globe is encircled and engirdled by
sea flowing round it, and this does not need theoretical
investigation‚ but has already been ascertained by
experience.

LXVII. Today the whole of the West is navigated
from Cadiz and the Straits of Gibraltar all round Spain
and France. But the larger part of the Northern
Ocean was explored under the patronage of his late

reached the region of Scythia and localities numb
with excessive moisture. On this account it is

the Indian Ocean to the Caspian Sea b was navigated
throughout by the Macedonian forces in the reigns
of Seleucus and Antiochus, who desired that it should
