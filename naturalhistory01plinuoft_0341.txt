connected with these heavenly causes. For it is
beyond question that the Ethiopians are burnt by
the heat of the heavenly body near them, and are
born with a scorched appearance, with curly beai-d
and hair, and that in the opposite region of the world
the races have white frosty skins, with yellow hair
that hangs straight3 while the latter are fierce
owing to the rigidity of their climate but the former

legs b themselves prove that with the former the juice

by the nature of heat, while with the latter it is
driven down to the lower parts by falling moisture3

found, in the former a great variety of animals and
especially of birds 3 but in both regions men’s stature
is high, owing in the former to the pressure of the
fires and in the latter to the nourishing effect of the

a healthy blending of both elements, there are traets
that are fertile for all sorts of produce, and men ire
of medium bodily stature, with a marked blending
even in the matter of complexion3 customs are
