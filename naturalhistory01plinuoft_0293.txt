typhoon does not occur with a northerly wind, nor a.
cloudburst with snow or when snow is lying. If it
flared up as soon as it burst the cloud, and had fire in
it, did not catch fire afterwards, it is a thunder-
bolt. It differs from a fiery pillar in the way in which
a flame differs from a fire: a fiery pillar spreads out
its blast widely, whereas a thunderbolt masses
together its onrush. On the other hand a tornado
differs from a whirlwind by returning, and as a whizz
differs from a crash3 a storm is different from either
in its extent—it is caused by the scattering rather
than the bursting of a cloud. There also occurs a
darkness caused by a cloud shaped like a wild
monster—this is direful to sailors. There is also what
is called a column, when densified and stiffened
moisture raises itself aloft; in the same class also is
a waterspout⁷ when a cloud draws up water like a pipe.
LI. Thunderbolts are rare in winter and in Thamm-
summer‚ from opposite causes. In winter, owing to ffllffmg‘fff
the thicker envelope of cloud, the air is rendered
extremely dense, and all the earth’s exhalation being
stiff and cold extinguishes whatever fiery vapour it
receives. This reason renders Scythia and the
frozen regions round it immune from the fall of
thunderbolts, while conversely the excessive heat
does the same for Egypt, inasmuch as the hot and
dry exhalations from the earth condense very rarely,
and only form thin and feeble clouds. But in spring
and autumn thunderbolts are more frequent, their
summer and winter causes being combined in each
of those seasons; thjs explains why they are fre-
quent in Italy, where the milder winter and stormy
summer make the air more mobile, and it is always
somewhat vernal or autumnal. Also in the parts of
