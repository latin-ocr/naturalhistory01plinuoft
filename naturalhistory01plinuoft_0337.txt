BOOK II. Lxxiv. 182—Lxxv. 185

shadow of the pin or ‘ gnomon ’ measures a little
more than half the length of the gnomon itself‚
whereas 1n the city of Rome the shadow ls {th shorter
than the gnomon, at the town of Ancona ¹ gth longer,
and in the district of Italy called Venezia705 the shadow
is equal to the gnomon, at the same hours.

LXXV. Similarly it is reported that at the town
of Syene, 5000 stades South of Alexandria, at noon
in midsummer no shadow is cast, and that in a well
made for the sake of testing this the light reaches
to the bottom, clearly showing that the sun is
vertically above that place at the time; and this is
stated in the writings of Onesicritus also to occur at
the same time in India South of the river Hypasis.“
It is also stated that in the Cave-dwellers’ city of
Berenice, and 4820 stades away at the town of
Ptolemais in the same tribe, which was founded
on the shore of the Red Sea for the earliest elephant
hunts‚ the same thing occurs 45 days before and 45
days after midsummer, and during that period of 90
days the shadows are thrown southward. Again in
hleroe—this is an inhabited island in the river Nile
5000 stades from Syene, and is the capital of the
Aethiopian race—the shadows disappear twice a
year, when the sun is in the lssth degree of Taurus
and in the 14th of Leo. There is a mountain named
Maleus in the Indian tribe of the Oretes, near which
shadows are thrown southward in summer and
northward in winter; the northern constellation is
visible there on only 15 nights. Also in India at the
well-known port of Patala the sun rises on the right
and shadows fall southward. It was noticed when
Alexander was staying at this place that the Great and
Little Bears were visible only in the early part of the
