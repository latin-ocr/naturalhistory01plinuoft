their approach is not so visible as their return,
whether after the blow a fire springs from it or the

pIn making these observations the Tuscans divided Auauyruvhy
the heaven into sixteen parts: the first quarter is '¹⁴⁴‘''“'¹‘
from the North to the equinoctia] sum-ise (East),
the second to the South, the third to the equinoctia}
sunset (West), and the fourth occupies the re-
maining space extending from VVest to North3
these quarters they subdivided into four parts each,
of Which they called the eight starting from the East
the left-hand regions and the eight opposite ones the
right-hand. Of these the most formidable are those
lying between West and North. Hence the line of
approach and the line of retirement of thundcrbolts
is of very great importance. It is best for them to
return to parts in the region of suni-ise. Accordingly
it will be a portent of supreme happiness when they
come from the first part of the sky and retire to the
same part—a sign that history records to have been
vouchsafed to the dictator Sulla; but all the others
are less fortunate or actually direful‚ in accordance
with the division of the actual firmament where they
occur. Some people think it wrong to give or to
listen to reports of thunderbolts‚ except if they are
told to a guest or a parent.

The great folly of paying attention to these occur-
