smoke whirls up. And I agree that these produce
storms, and if there is wind or steam struggling in
the cloud, it gives out claps of thunder‚ if it bursts
out on fire, flashes of lightning, if it forces its way on
3 longer track, beat-lightning. The latter cleaves
the cloud, the flashes burst through it, and thunder-
claps are the blows of the fires colliding‚ causing
fiery cracks at once to flash out in the clouds. It is
also possible for breath emerging from the earth,
when pressed down by the counter-impact of the

nature choking down the sound while the struggle
goes on but the crash sounding when the breath
bursts out, as when 3 skin is stretched by being
blown into. It is also possible for this breath‚ what-
ever it is, to be set on fire by the friction during its
headlong progress. It is also possible for it to be
struck 0111 by the impact of the clouds, as by that of
two stones, w ith beat-lightning flashing out like spar ks.
But all these occurrences are accidental—they cause
mere senseless and ineffectual thunder-claps, as their
coming obeys no principle of nature—they merely
cleave mountains and 5635, and all 111611· 011161· blows
are ineffectuah but the former α are prophetical
and sent from on high, they come by fixed causes and
from their own 51315.
