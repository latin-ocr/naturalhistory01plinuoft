not fall away, itself ranks with the marvellous. On
the other side the Greek investigators, greatly to
their delight and to their glory, prove by subtle
mathematica] reasoning that it cannot possibly be
the case that the seas are really flat and have the
shapc that they appear to have. For, they argue,
while it is the case that water travels downward from
an elevation, and this is its admitted nature, and
nobody doubts that the water on any coast has
reached the farthest point allowed by the slope
of the earth, it is manifest beyond doubt that the
lower an object is the nearer it is to the centre of the
earth, and that all the lines drawn from the centre to
the nearest bodies of water are shorter than those
drawn from the edge of these waters to the farthest
point in the sea : it therefore follows that all the water
from every direction converges towards the centre,
this pressure inward being the cause of its not falling
off.

LXVI. The reason for this formation must be (i'oherenceos
thought to be the inability of earth when absolutely {22⁶de
dry to cohere of itself and without moisture‚ and of
water in its turn to remain still without being held up
by earth ; the intention of the Artificcr of nature must
have been to unite earth and water in a mutual
embrace, earth opening her bosom and water pene-
trating her entire frame by means of a network of
veins radiating within and without, above and below,
the water bul-sting out even at the tops of mountain
ridges, to which it is driven and squeezed out by the
weight of the earth, and spurts out like a jet of water
from a pipe, and is so far from being in danger of
falling down that it leaps upward to all the loftiest
elevations. This theory shows clearly why the seas
