BOOK II. vm. 49—52

its size by the evidence of the eyes and by logical
inference, arguing that it is immeasurably large sor
the following reasons: (1) the shadow that it throws
of rows of trees along the balks of fields are at equal
distances apart for ever so many miles, just as if over
the whole space the sun were in the centre;‘² (2) during
the equinoxes it reaches the vertical simultaneously
for all the inhabitants of the southern region ; (3) the
shadows of the people living round the Tropic of Cancer
fall northward at midday but westward at sunrise‚
which could not happen unless the sun were much
larger than the earth ; (4) when it is rising its breadth
exceeds Mount Ida, overlapping it widely right and
left—and that though it is separated from it by so
great a distance.

The eclipse of the moon supplies indubitable
proof of the size of the sun, just as the sun itself
when it suffers eclipse proves the smallness of the
earth. For shadows are of three shapes, and it is
clear that, if the solid object that throws a shadow
is equal in area to the shaft of light, the shadow
projected is shaped like a pillar and is of infinite
length, but if the solid body is larger than the light,
the shadow has the shape of an upright spinning-top‚
so that it is narrowest at the bottom, and infinite
in length as in the former case, while if the solid is
smaller than the light the result is the figure of 3
cone narrowing down to end in a point, and this 'is
the nature of the shadow observed during an eclipse
of the moon; hence it is proved without any further
possibility of doubt remaining that the sun exceeds
the earth’s size. Indeed, this is also proved by the
silent testimony of nature herself ; for why in the
division of the turns of the year does the winter sun
