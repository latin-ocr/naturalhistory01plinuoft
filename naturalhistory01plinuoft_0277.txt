both from rivers and bays and from the sea even
when calm, and others, called altani, arising from the
land ; the latter when they come back again from the
sea are called turning winds, but if they go on, off-
shore winds.

The windings of mountains and their clustered
peaks and ridges curved in an elbow or broken off
into shoulders‚ and the hollow recesses of valleys,
cleaving with their irregular contours the air that is

that in many place causes words spoken to be end-
lessly echoed) are productive of winds. So again
are caverns, like the one with an enormous gaping
mouth on the coast of Dalmatia, from which, if
you throw some light object into it, even in calm
weather a gust like a whirlwind bursts out 3 the name
of the place is Senta. Also it is said that in the
province of Cyrenaica there is a certain cliff, sacred
to the South wind, which it is sacrilege for the hand
of man to touch, the South wind immediately causing
a sand-storm. Even manufactured vessels in many
houses if shut up in the dark have peculiar exhalations.

XLV. But there is a great differ-enee between a „W 0

gust of air and a wind. The latter, regular and
blowing steadily, and felt not by some particular
