doubtful. VVhether the sound of this vast mass
whirling in unceasing rotation is of enormous
volume and consequently beyond the capacity of
our ears to perceive, for my own part I cannot easily
say—any more in fact than whether this is true of the
tinkling of the stars that travel round with it,
revolving in their own orbits; or whether it emits a
sweet harmonious music that is beyond belief
charming. To us who live within it the world
glides silently alike by day and night. Stamped
upon it are countless figures of animals and objects
of all kinds—it is not the case, as has been stated by
very famous authors, that its structure has an even
surface of unbroken smoothness, like that which we
observe in birds’ eggs : this is proved by the evidence
of the facts, since from seeds of all these objects,
falling from the sky in countless numbers, particularly
in the sea, and usually mixed together, monstrous
shapes are generated3 and also by the testimony
of sight—in one place the figure of a bear, in another
of 3 bull, in another a wain, in another 3 letter of the
alphabet,‘¹ the middle of the circle across the pole
being more radiant.

For my own part I am also influenced by the
agreement of the nations. The Greeks have desig-
nat-ed the world by a word that means ⁸ ornament,' ὁ
and we have given it the name of mundus,⁰ because
of its perfect finish and grace! As for our word
caelum, it undoubtedly has the signification
‘ engraved,’ as is explained by Marcus Varro.‘¹
Further assistance is contributed by its orderly

¹¹ De Linqzca Latina V 18: engraved (caelum ‘chisel‚’
caedere) with the figures of the constellations. Caelum, ‘ the
vault of the sky,’ is really for cavilum, from cavus.
