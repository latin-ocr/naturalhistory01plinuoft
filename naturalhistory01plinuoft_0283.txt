BOOK II. XLVI. 120—van. 122

(S.S.E.) in the space between winter sunrise (SUE)
and midday (S), and also between Libs (S.W.) and
Notus (S.) the combination of the two, Libonotus
(S.S.W.), midway between midday (S.) and winter
sunset (S.W.). Nor is this the end, inasmuch as

others have also added one named Meses between
Boreas (NUE) and Caecias (E.N.E.), and Euronotus
between Eurus (SME) and Notus (SM) There are
also certain winds peculiar to particular races, which
do not go outside a special region, eg. the Athenians
have Sciron, slightly diverging from Argestes (N.W.)‚
a name unknown to the rest of Greece——elsewhere
the same breeze is called Olympias: customarily
all these names are taken to denote Argestes.
Some people call Caecias (E.N.E.) Hellespontias,
and others have other variants for these names.
Similarly in the province of Narbonne the most
famous of the winds is Circius (W.N.W.), which is
inferior to none other at all in force and which usually
carries a vessel right across the Ligurian Sea to
Ostia; the same wind is not only unknown in the
remaining quarters of the sky, but it does not even
touch Vienne‚ a city of the same province, a few
miles before reaching which this mighty wind is
checked by the obstacle of a moderate ridge of hills.
Fabianus asserts that South winds also do not pene-
trate Egypt—which reveals the law of nature that
even winds have their prescribed limits as well as
seasons.

XLVII. Accordingly the spring opens the seas
to voyagers; at its beginning the VVest winds soften
the wintry heaven, when the sun occupies the 25th
degree of Aquarius; the date of this is Feb. 8.
This also practically applies to all the winds whose
