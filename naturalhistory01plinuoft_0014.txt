INTRODUCTION

when the famous eruption of Vesuvius took place on
August 23 and 24, overwhelming the little towns of
Herculaneum and Pompeii. Pliny as a man ofscience
sailed across the bay to obtain a nearer view3 he
landed at Stabiae, and there was killed by poisonous
fumes. The circumstances are recorded by his
nephew in a letter to Tacitus (Pliny, Epp. VI. xvi).
Vespasian had died and had been succeeded as
Princeps by his son Titus two months before.

Pliny 's earlier writings were on subj ects suggested
by his professional experienceS‚ e.g., the use of the
javelin by cavalry, a history of the German wars,
the training of the orator. During his retirement he
produced Dubius Sermo, a treatise on grammar, and
later a continuation down to his own time of the
history of Rome by Aufidius Bassus3 and lastly
Natural Histmy, the largest and most important of
his works and the only one that has survived, although
his historical writings on the defence of the German
frontier and on the events of his own period were
clearly works of value, the loss of which is much to be
regretted. ΤΙῙε substance of both, however, is
doubtless largely incorporated in the writings of
Tacitus and Suetonius, the former indeed repeatedly
citing Pliny as his authority both in Annals and in
Histories.

Natural History is dedicated to TituS‚ who is
referred to in the Preface, ἓ 3, as ‘ sexies consul ';
this dates the completion of the work at ΑΛ). 77,
two years before the author’s death and the accession
of Titus. It is an encyclopaedja of astronomy,
meteorology, geography‚ mineralogy, zoology and
botany, z’.e. a systematic account of all the material
objects that are not the product of man's manu-
