that the divining powers of Anaxagoras covered a
greater marvel, and that our under-standing of the
physical universe is annihilated and everything thrown
into confusion if it is believed either that the sun is
itself a stone or ever had a stone inside it. But it
will not be doubted that stones do frequently fall. A
stone is worshipped for this reason even at the present
day in the exercising ground at Abydos—one of
moderate size‚ it is true, but which the same Anax-
agoras is said to have prophesied as going to fall in the
middle of the country. There is also one that is wor-
shipped at Cassandria, the place that has been given
the name of Potidaea‚‘² and where a colony was
settled on account of this occurrence. I myself
saw one that had recently come down ⁶ in the territory
of the Vocontii.

LX. The common occurrences that we call rainbows Rainbows.

for they do not reliably portend even rain or fine

repelled and is reflected back to the sun, and that the
diversified colouring is due to the mixture of clouds,

opposite to the sun, and never except in semi-circular
shape‚ and not at night time, although Aristotle
does state that a rainbow has been sometimes seen at
night, though he also admits that it cannot happen
except on the 14th day of the lunar month.⁶ Rain-
bows in winter occur chiefly when the day is drawing
in after the autumna] equinox3 when the day draws
out again after the vernal equinox they do not occur,
nor in the longest days about the solstice‚ but they
occur frequently in midwinter ‘¹3 also they are high
