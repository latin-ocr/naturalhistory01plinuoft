And can we wonder if earth has also generated some
ereatures for our harm? since the wild animals, I
well believe, are her guardians, and protect her from
sacrilegious hands3 do not serpents infest our mines,
do we not handle veins of gold mingled with the roots
of poison ? Yet that shows the goddess all the kinder
towards us, because all these avenues from which
wealth issues lead but to crime and slaughter and
warfare, and her whom we besprinkle with our blood

less, when at length our madness has been finally
discharged, she draws herself as a veil‚ and hides even
the crimes of mortals.

I would reckon this too among the crimes of our
ingratitude, that we are ignorant of her nature.

men’s judgement agreeS. We do undoubtedly 'n'
speak of the earth's spheoe, and admit that the globe
is shut in between poles. Nor yet in fact do all these
lofty mountains and widely spreading plains com-

circuit would produce a perfect sphere if the ends of
all the lines α were enclosed in a circumference. This
is the consequence of the very nature of things, it is
not due to the same causes as those we have adduced
in the case of the heaven3 for in the heaven the
convex hollow converges on itself and from all sides
rests upon its pivot, the earth, whereas the earth
being a solid dense mass rises like an object swelling,
and expands outward. The world converges to its
centre, whereas the earth radiates outward from its
centre, the ceaseless revolution of the world around
