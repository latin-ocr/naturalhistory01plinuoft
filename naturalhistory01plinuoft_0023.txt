PLINY NATURAL HISTORY

PREFACE

PLINIUS SECUNDUS To HIS DEAR VESPASIAN⁶ GREl-:TING

Mos'r Gracious Highness (let this title, a supremely
true one, be yours, while that of ‘ Most Eminent '
grows to old age with your sire)——I have resolved to
recount ἱ) to you, in a sornewhat presumptuous letter,
the offspring of my latest travail, my volumes of
Natural History (a novel task for the native Muses of
your Roman citizens)—

For ’twas e’er your way
To deem my trifles something worth ⁶

—to give a passing touch of polish to my ‘ opposite
number ' d-you recognize even this service slang—
Catullus (for he, as you know, by interchanging the
first syllables ‘³ made himself a trifle harsher s than he
wished to be considered by his ‘ darling Veraniuses
and Fabulluses ¹) ⁹ and at the same time that my
present sauciness may effect what in the case of
another impudent letter of mine lately you complained

⁰ Catullus wrote meas esse aliquid putare nuque.

V Perhaps alter Latin to give ‘ made it a little harsher than
he wished it to be thought.'

⁰ Catullus xii. 16, ut Veraniolum meum et Fabullum.
