BOOK II. xL1. 109—XL111. 112

the phases of the moonst affect the tissues of the shrew-
mouse, and that the smallest animal, the ant, is
sensitive to the influence of the planet and at the
time of the new moon is always slack. This makes
ignorance all the more disgraceful to man, especially
as 116 admits that with some cattle diseases of the
eyes increase and diminish with the moon. His
excuse is the heaven’s vastness, being divided at an
enormous height into 72 signs, that is, shapes of
things or of animals into which the learned have
mapped out the sky. In them they have indeed
noted 1600 stars as being specially remarkable for
their influence or their appearance, for instance the
seven which they have named the Pleiades in the
tail of the Bull and the Little Pigs b in his forehead‚
and Bootes,⁶ the star that follows the Seven Plough-

the earth exhales a damp mist and at other times a
smoky one due to vapour, and that clouds are formed
out of moisture rising to a height or air condensed
into moisture. Their density and bulk are con-
jectured with certain inference from the fact that
they obscure the sun, which is otherwise visible even
to those diving into water to whatever depth.

XLIII. Consequently Ι would not go against the Storms
view that it is also possible for the fires of stars to ζζζζξξά ³²⁹
fall from above into the clouds (as we often see happen
in finc weather‚ and the impact of these fires un-
questionably shakes the air since even weapons
when flung make a hissing noise) ; and that when they
reach the cloud, a hissing steam is produced, just as
when red-hot iron is plunged into water, and 3 6011 of
