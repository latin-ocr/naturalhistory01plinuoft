flat, all would be visible to all alike at the same
time3 also the nights would not vary in length,
because corresponding periods of 12 hours would
be visible equally to others fhan 'those at the equator,
periods that as it is do not exactly correspond in
every region alike.

LXXIII. Consequently also although night and
day are the same thing all over the world, it is not
night and day at the same time all over 'che world,
the intervention of the globe bringing night or its
revolution day. This has been discovered by many
experimcnts—that of Hannibal’s towers in Africa
and Spain, and in Asia when piratical alarms
prompted the precaution of watch’cowers of the same
sort, warning flrcs lit on which at noon were often
ascertained to have been seen by the people farthest
to the rear at 9 p.m. Alexander above mentioned
had a runner named Philonides α who did the 1200
stades from Sicyon to Elis in 9 hours from suni-ise
and took till 9 p.m.b for the return journey, although
the way is downhill; this occurred repeatedly.
The reason was that going his way lay with the sun
but returning he was passing the sun as it met him
travelling in the opposite direction. For this reason
ships sailing westward beat even in the shortest
day 'che distances they sail in the nights, because
they are going with the actual sun.

LXXIV. Travellers' sundials are not the same for
reference everywhere, because the shadows thrown
by the sun as they alter alter the readings at every
300 or at farthest 500 stades. Consequently in
Egypt at midday on the day of the equinox the

above sea-level than Sicyon, but only the latter part of the
return journey can be described as downhill.
