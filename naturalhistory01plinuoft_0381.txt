in the neighbourhood of Babylon and the parts of
Parthia near Astacus. Naphtha has a close affinity
with fire, which leaps to it at once when it sees it in
any direction. This is how Medea in the legend
burnt her rival, whose wreath caught fire after she
had gone up to the altar to offer sacrifice.
