months, and that the latter when above earth is
hidden twice in thirty days, but that this eclipse is
visible to different nations‚⁰ and—the most remarkable
features of this remarkable occurrence—that when
it comes about that the moon is obscured by the
shadow of the earth, this sometimes happens to it
from the west side and sometimes from the east3
and he also discovered for what exact reason, although
the shadow causing the eclipse must from sum-ise
onward be below the earth, it happened once in the
past that the moon was eclipsed in the west while
both luminaries were visible above the earth. For the
eclipse of both sun and moon within 15 days of each
other has occurred even in our time, in the year of
the third consulship of the elder Emperor Vespasian
and the second consulship of the younger.⁶

XI. It is unquestionable that the moon's horns Themoon’s
are always turned away from the sun, and that when phase'*
waxing she faces east and when waning west3 and
that the moon shines 47} minutes longer⁶ daily
from the day after new moon to full and 4722 minutes
less daily to her wane‚ while within 14 degrees of the
sun she is always invisible. This fact proves that the
planets are of greater magnitude than the moon,
since these occasionally become visible even on
reaching 7 degrees’ distance3 but their altitude
makes them appear smaller, just as the sun’s radiance
makes the fixed stars invisible in daytime, although
they are shining as much as in the night, which
becomes manifest. at a solar eclipse and also when
the star is reflected m a very deep well.
