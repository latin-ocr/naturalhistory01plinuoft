between Jupiter and Saturn half a tone, between
Saturn and the zodiac a tone and a half: the seven
tones thus producing the so-called diapason,‘¹ i.e.

XXI. A stade is equivalent to 125 Roman paces,²'
that is 625 feet. Posidonius holds that mists and
winds and clouds reach to a height of not less than
5 miles from the earth, but that from that point
the air is clear and liquid and perfectly luminous, but
that the distance between the cloudy air and the
moon is 250,000 miles and between the moon and
the sun 625‚OOO miles, it being due to this distance
that the sun's vast magnitude does not burn up the
earth. The majority of writers, however, have
stated that the clouds rise to a height of 111 miles.
These figures are really unascertained and impossible
to disentangle, but it is proper to put them forward
because they have been put forward already, although
they are matters in which the method of geometrica]
inference, which never misleads, is the only method
that it is possible not to reject, were anybody
desirous of pursuing such questions more deeply,
and with the intention of establishing not precise
measurement (for to aspire to that would mark an
almost insane absorption in study) but merely a
conjectural calculation. For since it appears from
the sun's revolution that the circle through which
its orb travels extends nearly 366 degrees, and since
the diameter of a circle always measures a little less
than ὲ ἦ- {T of the circumference, it appears that, as
