afterwards radiant; with these being causally con-
nected also the appearance of the fixed stars. For
at one time there is a dense crowd of stars in the sky
round the circle of the half-moon, a fine night giving
them a gentle radiance, but at another time they
are scarce‚ so that we wonder at their ssight, when
the full moon hides them or when the rays of the
sun or the planets above-mentioned dim our sight.
But the moon herself also is undoubtedly sensitive
to the variations of the strength of impact of the
rays of the sun, as moreover the curve of the earth
dulls their impact, except when the impact of the
rays meets at a right angle. And so the moon is
at half in the sun’s quadrature, and curved in a
hollow circle in its trinal aspect, but waxes to full
at the sun’s opposstion, and then waning exhibits
the same configurations at corresponding intervals,
on the same principle as the three planets above
the sun.

XVII. The sun itself has four differences, as there Τὴρ ,mn-‚⁹
are two equinoxes, in spring and autumn, when disserenoes
it coincides with the centre of the earth at the eighth
degree of Aries and Libra, and two changes of its
course, in the eighth degree of Capricorn at mid-
winter when the days begin to lengthen and in the
same degree of Cancer at the summer solsticc. The
variation is due to the slant of the zodiac‚ as at every
moment an equal part of the firmament is above and
below the earth; but the planets that follow a
straight path at their rising keep their light for a
longer tract and those that follow a slanting path
pass in a swifter period.
