that ceases beginning. When those next to the ones
falling rise, they go round from left. to right a like
the sun. The fourth moon usually decides about the
course of the winds for the monthfl Vessels by
means of slacking sheets can sail in contrary direc-
tions with the same winds‚ so that collisions occur,
usually at night, between ships on opposite tacks.
The South wind causes larger waves than the North-
east because the former being below blows from the
bottom of the sea but the latter from the top3
consequently earthquakes following South winds are
specially destructive. The South wind is more
violent at night and the North-east wind in the day-
time3 and easterly winds continue longer than
westerly. North winds usually stop after blowing an
odd number of days, an observation that holds good
in many other departments of nature also: this is
why the odd numbers are thought to be masculine.
The sun both increases and reduces the force of the
wind—the former when rising and setting‚ the latter
at midday in summer seasons; consequently the
winds are usually lulled at midday or midnight,
because either excessive cold or excessive heat makes
them slack. Also winds are lulled by rain3 but they
are most to be expected from quarters where the
clouds have broken, revealing a clear sky.

Eudoxus however thinks that (if we choose to
study the minima] circuits) there is a regular re-
currence of all phenomena—not only of winds bul:
largely of other soi-ts of bad weather as well—in
four- yearly periods, and that the peliod always
begins in a leap -year at the rising of Silius.

'These are our observations with iegard to the
winds that are regular.
