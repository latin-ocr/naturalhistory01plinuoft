on voyages—but their object is profit not know-
ledge ; and in their blind engrossment with avarice
they do not reflect that knowledge is a more re-
liable means even of making profit. Consequently
in view of these thousands of persons who go on
voyages I will give a more detailed account of the
winds than is perhaps suited to the task Ι have set
in hand.

XLVI. The ancients noticed four winds in all, Dessqnaticm
corresponding to the four quarters of the world (this oswzuds,
is the reason why even Homer mentions no more)—
a dull-witted system, as it was soon afterwards
considered3 the following age added eight—this
system on the other hand was too subtle and meticul-
ous. Their successors adopted a compromise‚ adding
to the short list four winds from the long one. There
are consequently two winds in each of the four
quarters of the heaven: Subsolanus blowing from
the equinoctia] suni-ise (E). and Vulturnus from the
winter sunrise (S.E.)—the former designated by the
Greeks Apeliotes‚ the latter Eurus3 Auster from the
sun at midday (S.) and Africus from the winter sunset
(S.W.)--named in Greek Notus and Libs; Favonius
from the equinoctia] sunset (W.)‚ Corus from the
sunset at the solstice (N.W.)—these the Greeks call
Zephyr and Argestes; Septentrio from the North
and Aquilo between him and sunrise at the solstice
(N.E.)—called in Greek Aparctias and Boreas.
The more numerous scheme had inserted four between
these: Thrascias (N.N.W.) in the space between
Septentrio (N.) and the sunset at the solstice (N.W.)
and also Caecias (ΕΝΗΕ) in the space between
Aquilo (NNE) and the equinoctial sum-ise (E.) on the
side of the sunrise at the solstice, and Phoenix
