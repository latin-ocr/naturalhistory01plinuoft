Samos 100, Chios 94, Mitylene 65, Tenedos 49, Cape
Sigeum l2.1, Bosphorus 3123, Cape Carambis 350,
mouth of Lake Maeotis 319ῐ, mouth of the Don
266, —a route that by cutting down the crossings
can be shortened. From the mouth of the Don
to the Canopic mouth of the Nile the most careful
authorities have made the distance 2110 miles.
Artemidorus thought that the regions beyond had
not been explored, though admitting that the tribes
of the Sarmatae dwell round the Don to the north-
ward. Isidorus added 1350 miles right on to Thule,
which is a purely conjectural estimate. I under-
stand that the territory of the Sarmatae is known to
an extent not less than the limit just stated. And
from another aspect, how large is the space bound to
be that is large enough to hold innumerable races
that are continually migr-ating? This makes me
think that there is an uninhabitable region beyond
of much wider extent ; for I am informed that beyond
Germany also there are vast islands that were dis-
covered not long ago.

These are thee· facts that I consider worth recor dino- Di nrm
in regard to the earth’s length and breadth. Its sm
total circumference was given by Eratosthenes (an
expert in every refinement of learning, but on this
point assuredly an outstanding authoiity—I notice
that he is universally accepted) as 252,000 stades,
a measurement that by Roman reckoning makes
31,5OO miles—an audacious venture, but achieved
by such subtle reasoning that one is ashamed to be
sceptiealfl Hipparchus, who in his refutation of

‘² Modern authorities say that, whatever his result, the
method of Eratosthenes was sound. See Hcath, Greek
Astronomy, pp. 109 ff.
