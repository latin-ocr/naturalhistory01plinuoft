PREFACE, 30—3 3

my part I have let these persons' eloquence run its
course.’ Plancus also put it neatly‚ when told that
Asinius Pollio was composing declamations against
him, to be published by himself or his children aster
Plancus’s death, so that he might be unable to
reply ι ⁸ Only phantoms fight with the dead! ’
This remark dealt those declamations such a nasty
blow that in cultivated circles they are thought the
most shameless things extant. Accordingly, being
safeguarded even against quibble-quarrellers (Cato’s
nickname for them—a neat compound word, for
what else do these people do but quarrel or seek a
quarrel ?) we will follow out the remainder of our
intended plan. As it was my duty in the public
interest to have consideration for the claims upon
your time, I have appended to this letter a table of
contents of the several books, and have taken very
careful precautions to prevent your having to read
them. You by these means will secure for others
that they will not need to read right through them
either, but only look for the particular point that
each of them wants, and will know where to find it.
This plan has been adopted previously in Roman
literature, by Valerius Soranus in his books entitled

Lady Initiates!
