BOOK II. exn. 247—cxm. 248

Eratosthenes and also in all the rest of his researches
is remarkable, adds a little less than 26‚OOO stades.

Dionysodorus (for I will not withhold this outstand-
ing instance of Greek folly) has a different creed.
He belonged to Melos, and was a celebrated geo-
metrician3 his old age came to its term in his native
place3 his female relations who were his heirs
escorted his obsequies. It is said that while these
women on the following days were carrying out the
due rites they found in the tomb a letter signed with
his name and addressed to those on earth,which stated
that he had passed from his tomb to the bottom of
the earth and that it was a distance of 42‚OOO stades.
Geometricians were forthcoming who construed this
to mean that the letter had been sent from the centre
of the earth’s globe, which was the longest space
downward from the surface and was also the centre
of the sphere. From this the calculation followed
that led them to pronounce the circumference of the
globe to be 252,000 a stades.

CXIII. To this measurement the principle of
uniformsty, which leads to the conclusion that the
nature of things is sels-consistent, adds 12‚OOO stades,
making the earth the ffffth part of the whole world.
