Greeks also give the name of ‘ bearded stars ’ to those
from whose lower part spreads a mane resembling a
long beard. ‘ J avelin-stars ' quiver like a dart3 these
are a very terrible portent. To this class belongs the
comet about which Titus Imperator α Caesar in his
5th consulship wrote an account in his famous poem,
that being its latest appearance down to the present
day. The same stars when shorter and sloping to a
point have been called ‘ Daggers ’3 these are the
palest of all in colour, and have a gleam like the flash
of a sword, and no rays, which even the Quoit-star,
which resembles its name in appearance but is in
colour like amber‚ emits in scattered form from its
edge. The ‘ Tub-star ' presents the shape of a cask,
with a smoky light all round it. The ‘ Horned star '
has the shape of a horn, like the one that appeared
when Greece fought the decisive battle of Salamis.
The ‘ Torch-star ' resembles glowing torches, the
⁴ Horse-star ’ horses’ manes in very rapid motion and
revolving in a circle. There also occurs a shining
comet ⁶ whose silvery tresses glow so brightly that it is
scarcely possible to look at it, and which displays
within it a shape in the likeness of a man's counten-
ance. There also occur ‘ Goat comets‚’ enringed
with a sort of cloud resembling tufts of hair. Once
hitherto it has happened that a ‘ Mane-shaped ’
comet ⁰ changed into a spear3 this was in the lOSth ’ἶ
