BOOK II. VI. 32-36

and among them the sun and moon, follow a course
contrary to that of the world, namely to the left,
the world always running to the right. (3) Although
they are borne on by it and carried westward with an
unceasing revolution of immeasurable velocity,
nevertheless they travel with an opposite motion
along their respective tracks. (4) Thus it comes
about that the air is not massed in a dull lethargic
ball by revolving in the same direction because of
the eternal rotation of the world, but is scattered into
separate portions by the opposite impact of the stars.
(5) Saturn is of a cold and frozen nature. The orbit
of Jupiter is much below it and therefore revolves
much faster, completing one rotation every twelve
years. The third star is Mars, called by some Her-
cules; owing to the proximity of the sun it has a
fiery glow; it revolves once in about two years, and
consequently, owing to its excessive heat and Saturn’s
frost, Jupiter being situated between them combines
the influence of each and is rendered healthy. (6)
Next‚ the sun’s course is divided into 360 parts, but
in order that an observation taken of the shadows
that it casts may come round to the starting-point,
five and a quarter days per annum are added3 con-
sequently to every fourth α year an intercalary day
is added to make our chronology tally with the course
of the sun.

Below the sun revolves a very large star named
Venus, which varies its course alternately, and whose
alternative names in themselves indicate its rivalry
with the sun and moon—when in advance and rising
before dawn it receives the name of Lucifer, as being
another sun and bringing the dawn, whereas when it
shines after sunset it is named Vesper, as prolonging
