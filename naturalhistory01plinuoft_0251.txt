half the circle is subtracted by the interposition of
the earth at the centre, the measure of the sun’s
altitude comprises about &th of this conjecturally
estimated immense space of the solar circle round
the earth, and the moon’s altitude Tlffth, since the
moon runs in a circuit that is much shorter than the
sun’s ; so that it comes between the sun and the earth.
It is marvellous to what length the depravity of man’s
intellect will go when lured on by some trifling
success, in the way in which reason furnishes impu-
dence with its opportunity in the case of the calcula-
tions above stated. And when they have dared to
guess the distances of the sun from the earth they
apply the same figures to the sky, on the ground that
the sun is at its centre, with the consequence that they
have at their finger’s ends the dimensions of the
world also. For they argue that the circumference of
a circle is ἐτ’- times its diameter, as though the measure
of the heavens were merely regulated from a plumb-
line! The Egyptian calculation published by
Petosiris and Nechepsos infers that one degree of the
lunar circle measures (as has been said) just over
4513- miles at the least, one degree of the widest
circle, Saturn’s‚ twice that size, and one of the sun's
circle, which we stated to be in the middle, the mean
between the other two. This computation is a most
shameful business, since the addition of the distance
of the zodiac itself to the circle of Saturn produces a
multiple that is even beyond reckoning.
