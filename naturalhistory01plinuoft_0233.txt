of Mei-cury in Capricorn, of the moon in the Bull,
at the middle of each, and the points lowest and
nearest to the centre of the earth are opposite. The
result of this is that they appear to move slower and
to be smaller when they are travelling at the highest
point of their circuit, but to be larger and travel
faster when they have come nearer to the earth, not
because they actually accelerate or reduce their
natural motions‚ which are fixed and individual to
them, but because lines drawn from the top of the
arc to the centre necessarily converge like the spokes
of a wheel, and the same motion at one time is
perceived as faster and at another slower according
to its distance from the centre.

Another reason of their elevations is because they
have the points of their arcs highest from their
eentre in different signs—Saturn in the 20th degree
of the Scales, Jupiter in the 15th of the Crab, Mars
in the 28th of Capricorn, the sun in the 29th of the
Ram, Venus in the 27th of the Fishes, Mercury in
the 15th of Virgo, the moon in the 4th of the Bull.

A third explanation of their altitudes is explained
by the dimensions of the firmament‚ not that of a
circle, the eye judging them to rise or to sink through
the depth of the air.

Linked with this is the cause of the latitudes of Orbitsosth
the zodiac and of its obliquity. The stars we have Ir'gfffissfllo)
mentioned α travel through the zodiac, and the only ‘'²‘' cedma.-
habitable part of the earth is what lies beneath it—
all the other parts towards the poles are frost-bound.
Only the planet Venus goes two degrees outside the
zodiac; this is understood to be the reason that
causes some animals to be born even in the desert
places of the world. The moon also wanders through
