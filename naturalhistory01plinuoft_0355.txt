BOOK ΙΙ. Lxxxlx. 203—XC11. 205

Before our time also among the Aeolian Islands
near Italy, as well as near Crete, there emerged
from the sea one island 2500 paces long, with hot
springs, and another in the 3rd yeara of Olympiad
163 in the bay of Tuscany, this one burning with a
violent blast of air; and it is recorded that a great
quantity of fish were floating round it, and that
people who ate of them immediately expired. So
also the Monkey Islands are said to have risen in the
bay of Campania, and later one among them, Mount
EpopOS, is said to have suddenly shot up a great
flame and then to have been levelled with the
surface of the plain. In the same plain also a town
was sucked down into the depths, and another
earthquake caused a swamp to emerge, and another
overturned mountains and threw up the island of
Procida.

XC. For another way also in which nature has Denachmem
made islands is when she tore Sicily away from ‘s'sg'ss'f‘fflffn
Italy, Cyprus from Syria, Euboea from Boeo-uastam.
Atalantes and Macrias from Euboea, Besbicus from
Bithynia, Leucosia from the Sirens' Cape. XCI.
Again she has taken islands away from the sca and
joined them to the land—Antissa to Lesbos, Zephyrius
to Halicarnassus, Aethusa to Myndus, Dromiscos
and Pernes to Miletus, Narthecusa to Cape Parthen-
ius. Hybanda, once an Ionian island, is now 25 miles
distant from the sea, Ephesus lias Syrie as part of
the mainland, and its neighbour Magnesia the
Derasides and Sapphonia. Epidaurus and Oricum
have ceased to be islands.
