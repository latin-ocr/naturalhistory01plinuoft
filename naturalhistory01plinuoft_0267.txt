which pours forth this breath of life. This region
below the moon, and a long way below it (as I notice
is almost universally agreed), blends together an
unlimited quantity from the upper clement of air and
an unlimited quantity of terrestrial vapour, being a
combination of both orders. From it come clouds,
thunder—claps and also munder-hosts, hail, frost‚
rain, storms and whirlwinds; from it come most of

elements of nature. The force of the stars presses
down terrestria] objects that strive to move towards
the sky, and also draws to itself things that lack spon-
taneous levitation. Rain falls, clouds rise, rivers dry
up, hailstorms sweep d0wn3 rays scorch‚ and im-

winds sweep down, and then go back again with their
plunder. So many living creatures draw their breath
from the upper air3 but the air strives in the opposite
direction‚ and the earth pours back breath to the
sky as if to a vacuum. Thus as nature swings to

velocity of the world’s motion. Nor is the battle
allowed to stand still, but is continually carried up
and whirled round, displaying in an immense globe
that encircles the world the causes of things, con-

interwoven with the clouds. This is the realm of
the winds. Consequently their nature is here
pre-eminent, and almost includes all the rest of
