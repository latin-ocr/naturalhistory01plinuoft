distributed all round the earth and stand with their
feet pointing towards each other, and that the top of
the sky is alike for them all and the carth trodden
under foot at the centre in the same way from any

persons on the opposite side don’t fall off—-just as
if it were not reasonable that the people on the
other side wonder that we do not fall off. There is
an intermediate theory that is acceptable even to
the unlearned crowd—that the earth is of the shape
of an irregular globe, resembling a pine cone, yet
nevertheless is inhabited all round. But what is the
good of this theory when there arises another marvel,
that the earth herself hangs suspended and does not
fall and carry us with it? As if forsooth there were
any doubt about the force of breath‚ especially when
shut up inside the world, or as if it were possible for
the earth to fall when nature opposes, and denies it
any place to fall to! For just as the sole abode of
fires is in the element of fire, and of waters in water,
and of breath in breath, so earth, barred out by all
the other elements, has no place except in itself.
Yet it is surprising that with this vast level expanse of
sea and plains the resulting formation is a globe.
This view has the support of Dicaearchus, a sanant of
the first rank, who with the support of royal patrons
took the measurement of mountains, and published
that the highest of them was Pelion, with an altitude
of 1250 paces‚‘² inferring that this was no portion
