the time that was left to study. Very often after
lunch-with him a light and easily digested meal, as
the fashion was in old days—in the summer, if he
had no engagements, he used to lie in the sun and
have a book read to him, from which he made notes
and extracts3 he read nothing without making ex-
tracts from it—indeed he used to say that no book
is so bad but that some part of it has value. After
this rest in the sun he usually took 3 cold bath, and
then a snack of food and a very short siesta‚ and then
he put in what was virtually 3 second day's work,
going on with his studies till dinner-time. Over his
dinner 3 book was read aloud to him and notes were
made, and that at 3 rapid pace. Ι remember that one
of his friends, when the reader had rendered a passage
badly, called him back and had it repeated3 but
my uncle said to him, ‘⁴ Surely you got the sense? '’
and on his nodding assent continued, ‘⁴ Then what
did you call him back for? This interruption of
yours has eost us ten more lines! '' Such was his
economy of time. He used to leave the dinner
table before sunset in summer and less than an hour
after it in winter—this rule had with him the force
of law. These were his habits when in the thick of
his engagements and amid the turmoil of town.
In vacation, only the time of the bath was exempted
from study 3 and when I say the bath I mean the more

shampooed and rubbed down he used to have some-
thing read to him or to dictate. On a journey he
seemed to throw aside all other interests and used
the opportunity for study only: he had a secretary
