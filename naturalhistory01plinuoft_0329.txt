the land more spacious! And to pass over the
collective insanities of the nations, this is the land
in which we expel the tenants next to us and add a
spade-full of turf to our own estate by stealing

marked out his acres most widely and banished his
neighbours beyond all record may rejoice in
owning—how small a fraction of the earth’s sur-
face? or, when he has stretched his boundaries to
the full measure of his avarice, may still retain—-

the clearest is the equal hours of day and night“

days and nights equal; and binoculars confirm this
very powerfully‚ since at the season of the equinox
suni-ise and sunset are seen on the same line, whereas
sunrise at midsummer and sunset at midwinter fall
