selves and at fixed times—compare the rising of the
Kids. But the rising of the constellation Arcturus
is almost always accompanied by a hail-storm.

XL. For who is not aware that the heat of the
sun increases at the rising of the Lesser Dog-star,
whose effects are felt on earth very widely? At its
rise the seas are rough‚ wine in the cellars ripples in
waves, pools of water are stirred. There is a wild
animal in Egypt called the gazelle that according to
the nativcs stands facing this dog-star at its rise, and
gazing at it as if in worship, after first giving a sneeze.
It is indeed beyond doubt that dogs throughout the
whole of that period are specially liable to rabies.

XLI. Moreover also the parts of some constella-
tions have an influence of their own—for instance
at the autumnal equinox and at mid-winter, when we
learn by the storms that the sun is completing its
orbit3 and not only by falls of rain and storum,
but by many things that happen to our bodies and

at every hour of the day turns with it, even when it is
obscured by a cloud. Indeed persistent research
has discovered that the influence of the moon causes
the shells of oysters, cockles and all shell-fish to grow
