the daylight‚ or as being a deputy for the moon.
This property of Venus was first discovered by
Pythagoras of Samos about the 42nd Olympiade
142 years after the foundation ²³ of Rome. Further it
surpasses all the other stars in magnitude, and is so
brilliant that alone among stars it casts a shadow by
its rays. Consequently there is a great competition
to give it a name, some having called it Juno‚ others
Isis, others the Mother of the Gods. Its influence
is the cause of the birth of all things upon earth3
at both of its risings it scatters a genita] dew with
which it not only fills the conceptive organs of the
earth but also stimulates those of all animals. It
completes the circuit of the zodiac every 345 days, and
according to Timaeus is never more than 46 dcgrees
distant from the sun. The star next to Venus is
Mercury‚ by some called Apollo; it has a similar
orbit, but is by no means similar in magnitude or
power. It travels in a lower circle, with a revolution
nine days quicker, shining sometimes before sunrise
and sometimes after sunset‚ but according to Cidenas
and Sosigenes never more than 22 degrees away from
the sun. Consequently the course of these stars
also is peculiar‚ and not shared by those above-
mentioned: those are often observed to be a quarter-
or a third of the heaven away from the sun and
travelling against the sun, and they all have other
larger circuits of full revolution, the specification of
which belongs to the theorv of the Great Year.⁶
But the wonder of everyone is vanquished by thc Maean

last star, the one most familiar to the earth, and

theory of the Cosmic Year is attributed to the Pythagoream
and to Heraclitus; Plato, Timaeus 39, gives its length as
10,000 years.
