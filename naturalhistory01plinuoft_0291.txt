XLIX. Now as to sudden blasts, which arise as Casuaz
has been saida from exhalations of the earth, and mmmmm·
fall back again to the earth drawing over st an envelope
of cloud; these occur in a variety of forms. The
fact is that their onrush is quite irregular‚ like that of
mountain torrents (as we have pointed outb is *the
view of certain persons), and they give forth thunder
and lightning. If travelling with a heavier momen-
tum they burst a great gap in a dry cloud, 'they
produce a storm called by 'the Greeks a cloudburst3
but if they break out from a downward curve of
cloudc with a more limited rotatim, they cause a
whirl unaecompanied by fire—I mean by lightning—-
that is called a typhoon‚ which denotes a whirling
cloudburst. This brings down with it a portion of
heat torn from a cloud, which it 'turns and whirls round,
increasing its own downward velocity by its weight‚
and shifting from place 'co place with a rapid whirl;
it is specially djsastrous 'co navigarem, as it twists
round and shatters not only the yards, but ⁴che vessels
themselves, leaving only the slender remedyofpouring
out vinegar in advanee of its approach, vinegar being
a very cold substance. The same whirlwind when
beaten back by its very impact snatches things up
and carries them back with it to the sky, sucking
them high alost.

ward pressing cloud but not so wide a one as in the ²⁰⁷²²'‘²¹⁰²⁷¹d·
case of a stom, and is accompanied by a crashing
noise, this is what they call a whirlxw’nd, which over-
throws everything in its neighbourhood. When the
same rages hotter and with a fier flow, it is called
a prester, as while sweeping away t e things it comes
in contact with it also scorches them up. But a
