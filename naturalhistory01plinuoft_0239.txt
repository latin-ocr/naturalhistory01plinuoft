XIV. First therefore let us state the reason why orbfesof
Venus never departs more than 46 degrees and iaznrssrssm
Mercury never more than 23 degrees from the sun,
and why they often retire and return towards the sun
within those limits. As situated below the sun both
have arcs that are the opposite of those of the other
planets, and as much of their circle is below the earth
as that of the planets mentioned before is above it;
and they cannot be further from it than they are
because the curve of their arcs does not allow
greater elongation there3 consequently the edges
of their arcs put a limit on a similar principle for
each, and compensate for the diinensions of their
longitude by the enlargement of their latitude.
But, it will be objected, why do they not reach 46 and
23 degrees always? As a matter of fact they do, but
the explanation escapes the theorists. For it is
manifest that even their arcs alter, because they never
cross the sun3 accordingly when the edges have
fallen on one side or the other into the actual degree
of the sun, then the stars also are understood to have
reached their longest distances‚ but when the edges
are short of that, they themselves too are com-
pelled to return with proportionately greater
velocity, since with each of them that is always the
extreme limit.

This also explains the contrary principle of their
motions. For the higher planets travel most quickly
in their evening setting‚ whereas these travel most
slowly‚ and the former are farthest from the earth
when their pace is slowest but the latter are highest
when their pace is quickest——the reason being that
with the latter the circumference of the circle
accelerates their pace in the same manner as
