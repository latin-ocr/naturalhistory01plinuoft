There is no such close alliance between us and the
sky that the radiance of the stars there also shares
our fate of mortality. When the stars are believed

proper place.⁰ Also the system of the revolutions
of the sky will be more appropriately stated when we
deal with geography‚b since it is entirely related to
the earth3 only we must not postpone the dis—

initial station. (2) The motions of all the planets‚
