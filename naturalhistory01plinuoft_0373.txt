have never reached bottom. CVI. This is rendered
more remarkable by springs of fresh water bubbling out
as if from pipes on the seashore. In fact the nature
of water also is not deficient in marvels. Patches of
fresh water float on the sui-face of the sea, being

doubtless lighter. Consequently also sea-water being Remarlcable

of a heavier nature gives more support to objects
floating upon it. But some fresh waters too float on
the surface of others3 cases are the river carried on
the surface of Lake Fucino, the Adde on the Lake of
Como, the Ticino on Maggiore, the Mincio on
Garda, the Ollio on Lago d'Iseo‚ the Rhone on the
Lake of Geneva (the last north of the Alps, but all
the rest in Italy), after a passing visit that covers
many miles carrying out their own waters only and
no larger quantity than they introduced. This has
also been stated in the case of the river Orontes in
Syria and many others. But some rivers so hate the
sea that they actually flow underneath the bottom of
it, for instance the spring Arethusa at Syracuse, in
which things emerge that have been thrown into the
Alpheus which flows through Olympia and reaches the
coast in the Peloponnese. Instances of rivers that flow
under ground and come to the surface again are the
Lycus in Asia, the Erasinus in the Argolid and the
Tigris in Mesopotamia3 and objects thrown into the
Spring of Aesculapius at Athens are given back again
in Phaleron Harbour. Also a river that goes under-
ground in the Plain of Atinas comes out 20 miles
further on, as also does the Timavus in the district
of Aquileia. In Lake Asphaltis in Judaea, which
produces bitumen, nothing can sink, and also in the
Aretissa in Greater Armenia; the latter indeed is a
nitrous lake that supports fish. A lake near the town
