BOOK II. v. 19-22

of the other gods, and also of the stars that I have
mentioned above, originated from the services of
men: at all events who would not admit that it is
the interpretation of men's characters that prompts
them to call each other Jupiter or Mercury or other
names, and that originates the nomenclature of
heaven? That that supreme being, whate’er it be,
pays heed to man’s affairs is a ridiculous notion.
Can we believe that it would not be defiled by so
gloomy and so multifarious a duty? Can we doubt
it? It is scarcely pertinent to determine which is
more profitable for the human race, when some men
pay no regar-d to the gods at all and the regard paid
by others is of a shameful nature: they serve as the
lackeys of foreign ritual, and they carry gods on their
fingers<23 also they pass sentence of punishment
upon the monsters they worship, and devise elaborate
viands for them3 they subject themselves to awful
tyrannies,so as to find no repose even in sleep3 they do
not decide on marriage or having a family ²³ or indeed
anything else except by the command of sacrifices;
others cheat in the very Capitol and swear false
oaths by Jupiter who wields the thunder—bolts—and
these indeed make a profit out of their crimes,
whereas the others are penalized by their religious

observances.
Nevertheless mortality has rendered our guesses Deification

about God even more obscure by inventing for itself ‘’sl'‘'r‘wl‘'
a deity intermediate between these two conceptions.
Everywhere in the whole world at every hour by all
men’s voices Fortune alone is invoked and named,
alone accused, alone impeached‚ alone pondered‚ alone
applauded, alone rebuked and visited with reproaches ;
deemed volatile and indeed by most men blind as well,
wayward, inconstamt, uncertain, fickle in her favours
