it Alexander the Great's eastern conquests also
explored as far as the Arabian gulf3 in which, when
Augustus's son Gaius Caesar α was operating there,
it is said that figureheads of ships from Spanish wrecks
were identified. Also when the power of Carthage
flourished, Hanno sailed round from Cadiz to the
extremity of Arabiast and published a memoir of his
voyage, as did Himilco when despatched at the same
date to explore the outer coasts of Europe. More-

when flying from King Lathyrus emerged from the
Arabian Gulf and sailed right round to Cadiz ‘3 and
much before him Caelius Antipater states that he had
seen someone who had gone on a trading voyage from
Spain to Ethiopia.d Nepos also records as to the
northern circuit that Quintus Metellus Celer, col-
league of Afranius in the consulship but at the time
pro-consul of Gaul, received from the King of the
Swabians a present of some Indians, who on a trade
voyage had been carried off their course by storms to
Germany. Thus there are seas encircling the globe
on every side and dividing it in two, so robbing us of

and appears to demand that I should display to the
eye and exhibit the extent of this whole indefinite
region in which rnen severally find no satisfaction.
