BOOK ΙΙ. Lx. 136-L111. 138

Italy that slope down from the north towards the
warmth, such as the district of Rome and the
Campagna, lightning occurs in winter just as in
summer, which does not happen in any other
localit .

LII.y Of thunderbolts themselves several varieties
are reported. Those that come with a dry flash
do not cause a fire but an explosion. The smoky
ones do not burn but blac-ken. There is a third sort,
called ⁴ bright thunderboltS,’ of an extremely remark-
able nature3 this kind drains casks dry without
damaging their lids and without leaving any other
trace, and melts gold and copper and silver in their
bags without singeing the bags themselves at all,
and even without melting the wax seal. Marcia,
a lady of high station at Rome, was struck by
lightning when enceinte, and though the child was
killed, she herself survive-d without being otherwise
injured. Among the portents in connexion with
Catiline, a town—councillor of Pompei named Marcus
Herennius was struck by lightning on a fine day.

LIII. The Tuscan writers hold the view that ·

there are nine gods who send thunderboltS‚ and that ‘³²⁴⁷‘

these are of eleven kinds, because Jupiter hurls three
varieties. Only two of these deities have been
retained by the Romans, who attribute thunderbolts
in the daytime to Jupiter and those in the night to
Summanus, the latter being naturally rare because
the sky at night is colder. Tuscany believes that

‘low bolts,' and that these are rendered exception-
ally direful and accursed by the season of winter,
though all the bolts that they believe of earthly
origin are not the ordinary ones and do not come
