PREFATORY NOTE

Tm: need for a new edition of this volume allows
me to correct some misprints and mistakes in the
text and translation. I am gratified to reviewers
for pointing out a few that I had not noticed myself.
Some of the mistakes of nomenclature were due 'to
the plan of publication, which precluded postponing
Book I, Pliny's Table of Contents, till the whole ofthe
treatise had been worked through and the objects
mentioned had been so far as possible identified by his

descriptions.
