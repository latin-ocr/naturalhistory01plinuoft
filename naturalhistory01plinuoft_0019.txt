VOLUME I ε CONTENTS

Pliny's Prqface. This is in the form of a covering
letter from Pliny, to accompany the gift of his
treatise on Natural History to his friend Vespasian
Caesar (i.e. the ruling Emperor Vespasian‘s son,
Titus, his successor as Princeps, who had already
been vested with Imperium and Tribunicio Potestas).
The reference to him in ξ 3 dates the passage:
see above, p. viii. The author goes on to say
that this dedication places the work outside the
class of books intended for the general reader,
and invites serious criticism. The subject does not
admit of an elevated style—the treatise is a plain
record of the facts of Nature, designed for utility
