they set and are never more than 11 degrees separate
from the sun at dawn when they rise. Afterwards
they retire from contact with his rayS‚ and make
their morning or ‘ first ’ stations in a triangle 120
degrees away, and subsequently their evening
risings opposite 180 degrees away, and again ap-
proaching from the other side, make their evening
or ‘ second ’ stations 120 degrees away, till the sun
overtaking them at 12 degi-ees obscures them—this
is called their evening setting. The planet Mars
being nearer feels the sun's rays even from its quad-
rature, at an angle of 90 degrees, which has given
to his motion after each rising the name of ‘ first’
or ⁴ second ninety—degree.’ At the same time
Mars remains stationary in the signs of the
zodiac for periods of six months (otherwise having a.
two-mouth period), whereas Jupiter and Saturn spend
less than four months in each station.‘¹ The two
lower planets (Mercury and Venus) are similarly
obscured at their evening conjunction, and when left
by the sun make their morning rising the same
number of degrees away, and from the further
limits of their distance follow the sun and when they
have overtaken him are hidden in their morning
setting and pass away. Then they rise in the even-
ing at the same distance apart, as far as the limits
we have stated. From these they pass backward to
the sun, and disappear in their evening setting. The
planet Venus actually makes two stations, morning
and evening, after each rise, from the furthest
