rises in a curve. Nevertheless nothing else in the
natural world is more visibly manifest. For (l)
hanging drops of liquid always take the shape of
small round globes3 (2) when dropped on dust or
placed on the downy surface of leaves they are seen
to be absolutely spherica13 (3) in goblets when filled
the surfaee curves upward most at the centre, though
owing to the transparency of the liquid and its
fluidity tending to find its own level this is more easily
discovered by theory than by observation3 and (4) a
still more remarkable fact is that when a very little
additional liquid is poured into a cup that has already
been filled the surplus overflows‚ but the opposite
happens when weighty solids, often as many as
20 coins, are put into it, presumably because these
pass inside the liquid and raise its surface to a peak,
whereas liquids poured on to the upward curving
surface slip off. (5) The same cause explains why
the land is not visible from the deck of a ship when in
sight from the masthead3 and why as a vessel
passes far into the distance, if some shining object
is tied to the top of the mast it appears slowly to sink
and finally it is hidden from sight. Lastly (6) what
other conformation could have caused the ocean,
which we acknowledge to be at the extreme outside‚
to cohere and not fall away, if there is no boundary
beyond to enclose it? The very question as to how,
