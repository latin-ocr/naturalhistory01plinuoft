limits of her distance. Mercury's stations have too
short a period to be perceptible.

XIII. This is the system of the shining and
occultation of the planets: it is more complicated
from their motion and involves many remarkable
facts, inasmuch as they change their magnitude and
their colom-s, and both approach the North and
retire towards the South‚ and suddenly are seen
closer to the earth or to the sky. And although our
account of these matters will differ in many points
from that of our predecessors, we confess that credit
for these points also must be given to those who
first demonstrated the methods of investigating
them: only nobody must abandon the hope that the
generations are constantly making progress.

All these occurrences are due to a plurality of duetoehree
causes. The first is the factor of the circles which causes.
in the case of the stars the Greeks designate apsides
or arcs (it will be necessary to employ Greek terms).
Each planet has its own circle, and these are not the
same as those of the firmament, since the earth
between the two vertices, named in Greek poles, is
the centre of the sky, and also of the zodiac, which
is situated on a slant between the poles. [All these
facts are always established beyond doubt by the
method of compasses.‘²] Therefore the special arc
of each is drawn from a different centre, and conse-
quently they have different orbits and dissimilar
motions‚ because the inner arcs must necessarily be
shorter.

It follows that the points of the arcs highest above
the centre of the earth are: in the case of Saturn
in Scorpio, in that of Jupiter in Virgo, of Mars in
Leo, of the sun in the Twins‚ of Venus in the Archer‚
