attribute the hurling of thunderbolts and light-

the cause of the rain of stones that sometimes occurs
is that the stones are caught up by the wind; and
likewise many other things. On this account more
facts have to be set out at the same time.

regular causes, but some that are accidental, or at
all events not hitherto explained. For who can
doubt that summer and winter and the yearly
vicissitudes observed in the seasons are caused by
the motion of the heavenly bodies? Therefore as
the nature of the sun is understood to control the
year’s seasons, so each of the other stars also has
a force of its own that creates effects corresponding
to its particular nature. Some are productive of
moisture dissolved into liquid, others of moisture
hardened into frost or coagulated into snow or
frozen into hail, others of a blast of air, others of
warnith or heat, others of dew, others of cold. But
it must not be thought that the stars are of the size
that they appear to the sight, since the consideration
of their immense altitude proves that none of them
is smaller than the moon. Consequently each of
them exercises its own nature in its own motion, a
fact which the transits of Saturn in particular make
clear by their storms of rain. Nor does this power [unumne os
