through the conveyance of soil by streams (as the
Echinades Islands when heaped up from the river
Achelous and the greater part of Egypt from the
Nile—the crossing from the island of Pharos to the
coast, if we believe Homer‚‘¹ having formerly taken
twenty-four hom-s) or by the retirement of the sea
as once took place at Circei ; such a retirement is
also recorded to have occurred to a distance of
1Ο,ΟΟΟ paces in the harbour of Ambracia, and to a
distance of 5900 at the Athenian port of Piraeus3
and at Ephesus, where once the sea used to wash up
to the temple of Diana. At all events if we believe
Herodotus? there was sea above Memphis as far as
the mountains of Ethiopia and also towards the plains
of Arabia, and sea round Ilium, and over the whole
territory of Teuthras ⁶ and where the Maeanderd
has spread prairie-land.

LXXXVIII. New lands are also formed in an-
other way, and suddenly emerge in a different sea
nature as it were balancing accounts with herself
and restoring in another place what an earthquake
has engulfed.

LXXXIX. The famous islands of Delos and
Rhodes are recorded in history as having been born
from the sea long ago, and subsequently smaller
ones, Anaphe beyond Melos, Neae between Lemnos
and the Dardanelles, Halone between Lebedos and
Teos, Thera and Therasia among the Cyclades in the
4th year e of the 145th Olympiad3 also in the same
group Hiera, which is the same as Automate, 130
years later; and 2 stades from Hiera, Thia 110
years later, in our age, on July 8 in the years of the
consulship of Marcus J unius Silanus and Lucius

Balbus.
