BOOK ΙΙ. c. 219—0111. 222

There is a town on the banks of the Guadalquivir
whose wells sink when the tide rises and rise when it
falls, remaining stationary in the intervening periods.
At Seville there is one well in the actual town that
has the same nature, though all the others are as
usual. The Black Sea always flows out into the Sea
of Marmora—the tide never sets inward into the
Black Sea.

CI. All seas excrete refuse a’c high tide, some

sensitive to it, the same force penetrating into all
thinws.
