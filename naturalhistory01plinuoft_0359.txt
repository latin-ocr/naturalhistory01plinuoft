multitudes of mankind3 such a variety of patterned
gems, such many-coloured markings in stones, and
among them the brilliance of a certain stone α that
only allows actual daylight to penetrate through it;
the profusion of medicinal springs3 the flames of
fire flickering up in so many places, unceasing for so
many centuries; the lethal breaths either emitted
from chasms or due to the mere formation of the
ground, in some places fatal only to birds, as in the
region of Soracte near Rome, in others to all living

as in the territory of Sinuessa and of Pozzuoli—the
places called breathing holes, or by other people
jaws of hell—ditches that exhale a deadly breath3
also the place near the Temple of Mephitis at
Ampsanctus in the Hirpinian district, on entering
which people die; likewise the hole at Hierapolis in
Asia, harmless only to the priest of the Great Mother;
elsewhere prophetie caves, those intoxicated by
whose exhalations foretell the future, as at the very
famous oracle at Delphi. In these matters what
other explanation could any mortal man adduce

from the city of Rome about 200 acres shake when
horsemen gallop over them, and similarly in the
Reate district. Certain islands are always afloat,
as in the districts of Caecubum and of Reate men-
tioned above and Modena and Statonium, and in
Lake Vadimo, the dense wood near the springs of
